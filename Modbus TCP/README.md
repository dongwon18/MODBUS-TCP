#Purpose
- Understanding Modbus TCP Protocol
- write simple Modbus TCP communication library code
- write code that read data from server

#File
- Modbus TCP library
  - library code that read multiple registers from server
  -                   write a register in server
  - following Modbus TCP protocol
- Reading Gas detector
  - Get data from Gas detector that use Modbus TCP protocol
  - Decode data from Gas detector according to address mapping sheet
  - by using local server, can test the code
